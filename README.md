# Traveling-Salesman-Problem-in-Romania
This project aims to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for Romanian cities using a genetic or heuristic algorithm. By analyzing city coordinates for optimal route calculation, the project seeks to find the shortest path that visits each city once and returns to the start.
